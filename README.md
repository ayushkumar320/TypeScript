# Learning TypeScript 🧠✨

Welcome to my TypeScript learning repository! This space is dedicated to documenting my progress as I explore TypeScript — a statically typed superset of JavaScript.

---

## 📚 Why TypeScript?

JavaScript is flexible, but sometimes *too* flexible. TypeScript adds static types to JavaScript, which helps:

- Catch errors early in development 🐞
- Improve code readability and maintainability 📖
- Enhance editor support with autocomplete and IntelliSense ✨
- Scale projects more effectively 📈

## 🛠️ Setup

1. **Install TypeScript globally** (if not already installed):

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```
```To run the file
tsc file.ts
```
