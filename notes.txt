Typescript is not about reinventing JavaScript

Typescript is just a way to write Javascript with a more precise manner

TypeScript is all about "type safety nothing else" : 
  Example: When we add 2 + "2" i.e we add string with a number, which in first case shouldn't be allowed gives a odd result of 22 (string). 
  Some more example: 
    - null + 2 = 2
    - undefined + 2 = NaN
